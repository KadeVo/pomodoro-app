<h1>Hello!</h1>

This project is primarily to help me understand React Native and create a tool that will be useful towards peoples future study. <br>

<h2>What the app currently has:</h2>

<li>
  <ul>Pomodoro Timer: We're talking 25-minute laser focus sprints, fueled by the magic of the Pomodoro Technique. Short breaks? Longer pauses? My app trakcs your pause time and you can adjust your study period.
  </ul>
  <ul>Firebase backend</ul>
</li>

<h2>What I intend to add:</h2>
<li>
  <ul>
    Notification system to remind you to study
  </ul>
    <ul>
    Track record of all your study sessions
  </ul>
  <ul>
    Total amount of time studied and total amount you have paused
  </ul>
</li

  <h3>Fun fact</h3>
  I have used this application during my study period for the AZ-900 exam which helped me stay focused and help me pass the exam within a week of study.
