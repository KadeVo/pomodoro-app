<h1>Hello!</h1>

This project is primarily to help me understand React Native and create a tool that will be useful towards peoples future study. <br>
  <h3>Fun fact:</h3>

  I have used this application during my study period for the AZ-900 exam which helped me stay focused and help me pass the exam within a week of study.


<h2>What the app currently has:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Pomodoro Timer: We're talking 25-minute laser focus sprints, fueled by the magic of the Pomodoro Technique. Short breaks? Longer pauses? My app trakcs your pause time and you can adjust your study period.
  </li>
  <li>Firebase backend</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I intend to add:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Notification system to remind you to study
  </li>
    <li>
    Track record of all your study sessions
  </li>
  <li>
    Total amount of time studied and total amount you have paused
  </li>
</ul>
